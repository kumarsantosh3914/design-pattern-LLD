# What is the Sinleton Pattern?
- The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one
  instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful in scenarios
  where exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

# Where Do We Need the Singleton Pattern?
- The Singleton Pattern is used when:
  1. Resource Management: You need a centralized point of control for a
     shared resource, like a database connection or a configuration manager.
  2. Global State: A single instance is required to represent a global state, 
     like a logging service or a cache.
  3. Coordination: One instance is necessary to coordinate actions across 
     various parts of the system, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts.
